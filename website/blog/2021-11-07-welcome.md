## Welcome To The Legendary Labs Docs Site!

Here in the docs site all developers, and non-developers, associated with the **Legendary Labs** project can aggregate technical knowledge and details regarding their sections of the project! 

Feature updates, code changes, and project updates can all be posted here in our **Updates** section for better organization.

Adding to the **Docs** and **Updates** sections is extremely easy, as the pages are simply written in Markdown and stored in the correct directory. In the coming days I plan to have an easy How-To published for those wishing to contribute.

One of my primary goals with these docs is to provide everyone in the project the same level of understanding that I have with the Smart Contract code, without necessarily having to read the code (though I of course recommend everyone at least takes a peak). That being said, if there is anything still vague or unclear, please let me know so that I can update the docs with additional details!
